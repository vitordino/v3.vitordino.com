  The internet changed rather fast, both on its adoption, usage and technology behinds it. If we look at web development just for the last 2, 5 or 10 years, we can easily be tricked they’ve come from completely different worlds.

  I remember the first steps I’ve made from being just a designer and to adventure myself on some `html` and `css`. And it seemed pretty magical to me — maybe because I’ve had plenty of mentorship and guidance.

css is pretty easy, right? It’s just applying some style rules to a specific element, what could go wrong?
